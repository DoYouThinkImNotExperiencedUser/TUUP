# The ultimate useless program
"Waste of your storage and computation power, run this code, for absolutely no reason!"

## What it is and what does it do?
It is code written in c++ that runs infinite loop, that outputs to terminal current number then " SPACE " and another number (e.g `1 SPACE 2`).
It also writes to `log.txt` file to log numbers, date and time.

## Why?
I fucking made it just for fun, yes its useless and short. But who knows, someone might find good use for it.

## Compiling
In Linux you run `g++ main.cpp` in terminal.
